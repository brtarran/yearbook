The BFI is the lead organisation for film in the UK. Founded in 1933, it is a registered charity governed by Royal Charter. In 2011, it was given additional responsibilities, becoming a Government armâ€™s-length body and distributor of Lottery funds for film, widening its strategic focus.

The BFI now combines a cultural, creative and industrial role. This brings together activities including the BFI National Archive, distribution, cultural programming, publishing and festivals with Lottery investment for film production, distribution, education, audience development and market intelligence and research.
