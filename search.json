    "text": "All cinema releasesUK filmsUK independent films\n\n\nThe top performing cinema release in the UK and Republic of Ireland in 2021 was No Time to Die with earnings (to 13 February 2022) of just under £97 million (Table 1). The 25th outing in the James Bond franchise – one of a host of big-tent releases rescheduled from 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic – became the third highest grossing film of all time at the UK and Republic of Ireland box office, behind 2015’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens (£123 million) and 2012’s Skyfall (£103 million). The second most popular release of the year was Spider-Man: No Way Home with earnings (to 13 February 2022) of just under £93 million, a figure which ordinarily would have seen it top the annual chart. The top two films alone accounted for almost one third (31%) of the year’s total theatrical gross.\nFive films earned £20 million or over in 2021, up from only one in 2020 but significantly below a pre-pandemic total of 17 in 2019. The top 20 films in 2021 had a combined gross of £451 million, which accounted for 72% of the total UK and Republic of Ireland box office. In 2020, the top 20 films earned £201 million (80% of the total gross), and in 2019 they earned £767 million (59%). Seven of the top 20 releases in 2021 were UK qualifying films (the same as in 2020, but down from nine in 2019), all of which were UK studio-backed productions. Sequels and franchise films accounted for 16 of the top 20 titles compared with five in 2020 and 16 in 2019. Action and comedy were the two most popular genres, both in terms of number of releases and box office takings. Action accounted for seven titles, including No Time to Die, Spider-Man: No Way Home and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, which between them earned £278 million, while comedy had three releases - Free Guy, Space Jam: A New Legacy and Ghostbusters: Afterlife - which grossed £41 million.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Box office results for the top 20 films released in the UK and Republic of Ireland, 2021.

This is just over double the £113 million earned by the top 20 UK films released in 2020 (46% of the total box office), but less than half of the £527 million grossed in 2019 (41% of the total box office).\nFive UK films earned over £10 million in 2021, compared with four in 2020 and 16 in 2019. The top 20 list is dominated by UK/USA collaborations, most of which were studio-backed productions. Seven of the top 20 titles were UK independent films, down from 15 in 2020 and eight in 2019. These seven titles accounted for 8% of the total box office for the top 20 UK films, down from 30% in 2020 (when the shortfall in the number of studio releases due to the COVID crisis meant independent UK films took a greater than usual share of the box office) and 19% in 2019.\nThe number of genres in the top 20 illustrates the range of UK film production. Action, with a combined box office of £158 million from five titles (including the top earning film of the year, No Time to Die), was the highest earning genre, while eight other genres were represented: animation, biopic, comedy, family, fantasy, horror, musical, and sci-fi.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Box office results for the top 20 UK films released in the UK and Republic of Ireland, 2021.

These films accounted for 4% of the overall UK and Republic of Ireland box office, down from 14% in 2020 and 11% in 2019.\nThe top grossing UK independent film in 2021 was The French Dispatch with earnings (to 13 February 2022) of £4 million. The film is one of a number of inward investment titles in the top 20. (Other films in this category include The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard, 83 and Chal Mera Putt 3.)\nGenerating £12 million from six releases, comedy was the biggest earning genre across the top 20 while drama titles made up the greatest number of releases (eight). Comedies included the two top grossing titles The French Dispatch and The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard, while drama releases included The Father and Supernova. The list also includes two biopics, two thrillers, one family title and one romance.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Box office results for the top 20 UK qualifying independent films released in the UK and Republic of Ireland, 2021.

As with the UK, the majority of territories saw increased attendances in 2021 in comparison with 2020 but cinema-going in every territory remained well below the level of admissions in 2019. The two territories reporting numbers of ticket sales in 2021 closest to those of 2019 were China (down only 32%) and Russia (-34%) while those with the greatest shortfall between 2019 and 2021 were Indonesia (-82%), Italy (-74%) and South Korea (-73%).\nAccording to Omdia, global cinema admissions in 2021 totalled 3.3 billion, an increase from 1.9 billion in 2020, but still 57% down on the 7.6 billion recorded in 2019.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Largest film markets by admissions, 2019-2021 (ranked by 2021 admissions).

Download this data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2 shows UK cinema admissions by month between 2019 and 2021. The figures show both the shortfall in admissions in comparison with the pre-pandemic totals of 2019 and the year-on-year recovery in attendances seen during some months in 2021. It should be noted, however, that following the re-opening of cinemas in the UK in late spring 2021, one or more restrictions (such as mask wearing, social distancing, capacity limits and mandatory vaccine passports) were in operation in some or all parts of the country for the remainder of the year. (Cinemas began reopening in England, Scotland and Wales from 17 May, and in Northern Ireland from 24 May.)\nThe first film to top the UK box office charts when cinemas reopened in 2021 was the family-friendly Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway which grossed £4.6 million (in the UK and Republic of Ireland) on its seven-day opening. (Its Friday to Sunday total of £3.8 million was the biggest three-day opening gross in the territory since Sonic the Hedgehog which earned £4.7 million for its three-day debut in February 2020.) The film was one of three top 20 titles released in May and heralded a summer dominated by action, adventure and comedy titles which attracted younger audiences in particular back to cinemas. After May openers Cruella (a UK qualifying film) and the US horror title The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, top 20 earners in the summer included UK studio-backed titles Black Widow and Fast & Furious 9, along with Space Jam: A New Legacy, The Suicide Squad, Jungle Cruise, The Croods: A New Age and Free Guy. Top grossing UK independent films released in the summer included the year’s second highest earning UK independent title, The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard alongside The Father, The Courier and People Just Do Nothing: Big in Japan.\nAdmissions rose each month between May (3.5 million) and August (10.4 million) but fell in September to 6.5 million. Traditionally one of the slowest months for ticket sales, September did, however, see the opening of the year’s fourth highest earning release Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. The superhero blockbuster, the 25th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the first to feature an Asian lead, had the largest opening weekend of the year thus far with a three-day gross of £5.8 million.\nShang-Chi’s three-day record was soon overtaken by the debut of another official 25th outing. The much delayed 007 instalment, No Time to Die, originally scheduled for release in April 2020, grossed £21 million on its three-day opening (£25.8 million including Thursday previews), the highest Friday to Sunday tally for a Bond film ever in the UK and Republic of Ireland. Officially released on 1 October, No Time to Die would go on to become the UK’s third highest ever release with a gross of £97 million and was the first film of the year to entice substantial numbers of older audience members back to the cinema. Alongside three other top 20 earners – Dune, the UK studio-backed title Venom: Let There Be Carnage and The Addams Family 2 – and the top earning UK independent film of the year, The French Dispatch, No Time to Die helped propel October’s ticket sales to the highest total of the year at 16.4 million. October was the only month to see an increase in admissions compared with the equivalent month in 2019.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Monthly UK cinema admissions, 2019-2021. Source: CAA, Comscore.

    "text": "The chart below puts UK admissions in a longer-term perspective. Along with the USA and other western European countries, cinema-going in the UK declined sharply in the post-war era as incomes rose and new leisure activities became available. The largest competition came from the growth of television, which allowed audiences to satisfy their appetite for screen entertainment in the comfort of their own homes. As cinema admissions fell so did the supply of screens, which led to further falling demand and more cinema closures. By the 1980s the number and quality of the remaining cinemas were at an all-time low. The popularisation of the VCR in the same decade had a further negative impact on attendances, and by 1984 ticket sales had plummeted to a 50-year low of 54 million. However, the introduction of multiplex cinemas to the UK from 1985 onwards began to reverse the trend and ushered in a new period of growth which saw admissions gradually returning to levels last seen in the early 1970s. In the decade prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (2010-2019) attendances topped 170 million in six different years, peaking in 2018 with the highest admissions since 1970. The onset of the pandemic in the UK in 2020 caused massive disruption to the cinema sector: admissions for the year fell to an all-time low of 44 million. While the impact of the pandemic continued into 2021, admissions began to recover with total tickets sales for the year up by more than two-thirds compared with 2020.",
